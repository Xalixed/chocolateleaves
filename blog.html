				<h3>Entry 3 - I Saw The Best Movie Of All Time It Was So Cool<br><small>written by kaz at 02/21/26 3:35 AM <sub>is anyone else gonna use this blog orrrr</sub></small></h3>
				<p>me and my bf watched The Thing (1982) last night, might actually be the greatest movie ive ever seen. i would talk more about it but i wouldnt want to spoil it, PLEASE watch it for yourself its SO GOOD. also below this post there definitely isnt a black hyperlink to a website where you can watch it for free, thatd be pretty bad. piracy is bad and i do not condone it.</p>
				<p>off topic but i love my bf so much hes literally the best ever i wish i could spend more time with him :3</p>

				<h3>Entry 2 - Wait We Can Have Individual Bios Again Fuck Yea !!!<br><small>written by kaz at 02/20/26 12:00 AM</small></h3>
				<p>our old carrd had individual bios for alters, either written by themselves or me. we ended up replacing it with our current carrd since there were too many to stay under carrds 50 element limit for free accounts</p>
				<p>BUUUUT now that we have our own website and can do What Ever The Fuck We Want, we can actually bring that back! yay! woohoo! thatll be a bit tho we still got stuff to work on here on the main page</p>
