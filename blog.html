				<h3>Entry 5 - I FUCKING LOVE THRIFT SHOPPING!!!<br><small>written by kaz at 02/25/26 4:42 AM</small></h3>
				<p>i went to a thrift store today and picked up an HP w2207h. the cool thing about it is that it can rotate on its side so i can fit more code on my screen!</p>
				<p>for some reason it starts flickering whenever the aspect ratio is 16:10 even though thats what it is, regardless of resolution. ill try getting that fixed because right now text is all blurry and i no like it :(</p>

				<p>i see the windshield of my car is totally CAKED in ice. no biggie i'll just get the ice scraper from the...</p>
				<p>ah.</p>
				<p>the trunk wont open.</p>
				<p>the rear doors won't open, either.</p>
				<p>also while i was waiting for the car to heat up to melt the ice (didnt work btw) i heard on the radio there's patches of black ice on the road</p>
				<p>so were basically unable to get to school without throwing all safety out of the window lmao yea no fuck that were just not going today. nuh uh!</p>
				<p>also shout out to silas for writing emails to all our teachers abt it 🔥🔥🔥</p>

				<h3>Entry 3 - I Saw The Best Movie Of All Time It Was So Cool<br><small>written by kaz at 02/21/26 3:35 AM <sub>is anyone else gonna use this blog orrrr</sub></small></h3>
				<p>me and my bf watched The Thing (1982) last night, might actually be the greatest movie ive ever seen. i would talk more about it but i wouldnt want to spoil it, PLEASE watch it for yourself its SO GOOD. also below this post there definitely isnt a black hyperlink to a website where you can watch it for free, thatd be pretty bad. piracy is bad and i do not condone it.</p>
				<p>off topic but i love my bf so much hes literally the best ever i wish i could spend more time with him :3</p>

				<p>our old carrd had individual bios for alters, either written by themselves or me. we ended up replacing it with our current carrd since there were too many to stay under carrds 50 element limit for free accounts</p>
