				<h3>Entry 1 <br> 02/16/26 9:41 PM</h2>
				<p>yay the website works woohoo yea yippee! all i really have to do now is Make The Actual Website. not fun since i dont even know that much html :( what is css why do i need counter strike source to make a website
				<br>
				i will admit i used chatgpt to handhold me through setting it up, since i am VERY unfamiliar with how this all works. HOWEVER all code for the website will be 100% human written, if not copy and pasted from w3schools or other websites (WITH PERMISSION)</p>

				<h3>Entry 2 <br> 02/18/26 1:10 AM</h2>
				<p>i learned a lil bit of css and what divs are, so i decided to clean this website up and totally rewrite it!
				<br>
				i also got permission from a friend of mine to reuse some portions of code from her website, so that's cool! thanks sparrow :D (in fact, thats how i discovered divs)</p>
				<p><a href="https://sparrowbeedotorg.neocities.org/">heres her website btw, its pretty cool :)</a>

				<h3>5:34 AM</h2>
				<p>ill admit i just typed in the chatbox and copy pasted commands and error codes i have absolutely NO CLUE how git works. but uh i think i did it! yay! now i can update the repo from my own console, so i dont have to edit the website via githubs own website lol</p>

			<h2>Our usage of AI</h2>
			<p>i (kaz) used AI to handhold me through the process of setting up nginx, updating the site via git, etc. <b>no code on any website of ours will be AI generated,</b> though some portions may be assisted (basically just googling "hey how do i make a border in html")</p>
			<p>i'm just putting this here because i feel dishonest when i say that i "did something" when really i got ai to tell me what to paste into the funny command prompt to make the funny domain show my funny html file</p>
