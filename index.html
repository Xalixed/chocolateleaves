				<h3>Entry 1 <br> 02/16/26 9:41 PM</h3>
				<p>yay the website works woohoo yea yippee! all i really have to do now is Make The Actual Website. not fun since i dont even know that much html :( what is css why do i need counter strike source to make a website
				<br>
				i will admit i used chatgpt to handhold me through setting it up, since i am VERY unfamiliar with how this all works. HOWEVER all code for the website will be 100% human written, if not copy and pasted from w3schools or other websites (WITH PERMISSION)</p>

				<h3>Entry 2 <br> 02/18/26 1:10 AM</h3>
				<p>i learned a lil bit of css and what divs are, so i decided to clean this website up and totally rewrite it!
				<br>
				i also got permission from a friend of mine to reuse some portions of code from her website, so that's cool! thanks sparrow :D (in fact, thats how i discovered divs)</p>
				<p><a href="https://sparrowbeedotorg.neocities.org/">heres her website btw, its pretty cool :)</a>

				<h3>Entry 3 <br> 02/18/26 5:10 AM</h3>
				<p>i wanted to get more work done this morning but my friends pulled me away shortly after i wrote that entry. now i only have an hour until i gotta go to the school :( ill try to figure out how to update the repo via konsole with this little time i have</p>
				<h3>5:34 AM</h3>
				<p>ill admit i just typed in the chatbox and copy pasted commands and error codes i have absolutely NO CLUE how git works. but uh i think i did it! yay! now i can update the repo from my own console, so i dont have to edit the website via githubs own website lol</p>

				<h3>Entry 4 <br> 02/19/26 1:17 AM</h3>
				<p>kk im planning to make the website actually like navigatable now. i heard tables are a cool trick to position text instead of using css so im gonna try that</p>
				<h3>2:20 AM</h3>
				<p>i ended up using a sidebar instead of a header. idk why i did that since theres no need for a full on sidebar buuuut smth smth sunk cost fallacy. also using an iframe for it miiiight use more bandwidth than preferable but how else will i make the sidebar the same across all the sites</p>
				<h3>3:26 AM</h3>
				<p>got distracted stealing stamps and blinkies off of tumblr whoops. anyway the website is basically almost done, i just need to add actual information. then i can get to adding the fun stuff! <br> also i guess i can use the free space on the navbar for random stuff that wouldnt fit elsewhere, like a collection for those aforementioned stamps and blinkies</p>
				<h3>4:16 AM</h3>
				<p>OK FINALLY. I DID IT. its all there, i even added the song thingy! i hope nobody will care that im basically redistributing peoples music through that >.>"</p>
				<p>i should probably add a changelog on the sidebar too, nobody wants to read a whole devlog to know whats new. whatevs ill do that later, ive done enough coding for this morning :P</p>
				<small>i just realized i forgot to do the entire art page. whatever i can do that later too</small>

			<h2>Our usage of AI</h2>
			<p>i (kaz) used AI to handhold me through the process of setting up nginx, updating the site via git, etc. <b>no code on any website of ours will be AI generated,</b> though some portions may be assisted (basically just googling "hey how do i make a border in html")</p>
			<p>i'm just putting this here because i feel dishonest when i say that i "did something" when really i got ai to tell me what to paste into the funny command prompt to make the funny domain show my funny html file</p>
